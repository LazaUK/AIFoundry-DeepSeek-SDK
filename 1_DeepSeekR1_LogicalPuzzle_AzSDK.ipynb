      "Okay, let me try to figure this out step by step. So we have three people: Alice, Bob, and Carol. Each of them has a favorite color, which are red, blue, and green. No two people share the same favorite color. The problem gives us some clues, so I need to break them down one by one and see how they fit together.\n",
      "\n",
      "First, let's list out the people and the colors again to keep track:\n",
      "\n",
      "People: Alice, Bob, Carol.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colors: Red, Blue, Green.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each person has a unique color. Now, let's look at the clues provided.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Alice doesn't like red. So Alice's favorite color can't be red. That means her favorite has to be either blue or green. We'll note that down: Alice ≠ Red.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Bob's favorite color is not blue. So Bob doesn't like blue, which leaves him with red or green. So Bob ≠ Blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Carol's favorite color is red. So Carol = Red. That's straightforward. So Carol is definitely red. That means the other two (Alice and Bob) can't have red as their favorite. Which also affects our previous notes. Wait, because originally, we were told that Alice doesn't like red, but Carol already took red. So actually, since Carol is red, that automatically makes the other two (Alice and Bob) have to choose between blue and green. But Bob's favorite isn't blue from clue 2, so Bob must choose green. Then Alice is left with blue. Wait, is that correct? Let me check again.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait, let's lay this out systematically. Let me start by assigning Carol first because that's the most direct clue. Carol = Red. So that's fixed. Now, the remaining colors are blue and green, which need to be assigned to Alice and Bob.\n",
      "\n",
      "Alice's clue says she doesn't like red, but since Carol is already red, we know Alice can't be red anyway. But the clue is still useful because if Carol wasn't given, maybe Alice could have been another color, but in this case, Carol's assignment of red just reinforces that. So Alice has to choose between blue and green.\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, Bob's clue is that his favorite isn't blue. So Bob must be either red or green. But wait, since Carol is red, Bob can't be red. So Bob's only option is green. That leaves Alice with blue. So Alice = Blue, Bob = Green, Carol = Red.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wait a minute, let's double-check. Let's make a table to ensure we don't make any mistakes.\n",

      "\n",
      "But since Carol is Red, that color is taken, so Alice and Bob can't be red. So Alice's possibilities are Blue and Green, and Bob's possibilities are Red (but already taken by Carol) and Green. But Bob can't be Blue from clue 2, right? So Bob can't be Blue, but since Carol is Red, the only remaining colors are Blue and Green. But Bob's clue says not Blue, so Bob must be Green. Therefore, Alice must be Blue. Let me verify:\n",

      "- Bob: Green (since he can't be Blue, and Red is taken)\n",

      "2. Bob's color isn't blue. Correct, he's green.\n",
      "3. Carol is red. Correct.\n",

      "Everything seems to fit. I don't see any contradictions here. So the solution should be Alice likes blue, Bob likes green, and Carol likes red.\n",

      "3. **Bob's Constraints**: Bob’s favorite isn’t blue. With red already taken by Carol, Bob must be **green** (the only remaining option).  \n",
      "   → *Bob ≠ Blue → Bob = Green*\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Alice’s Assignement**: With blue and green left, and Bob assigned green, Alice defaults to **blue**.  \n",
